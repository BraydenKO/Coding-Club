Some random things I've made in Coding Club

## Tic Tac Toe

Uses pygame to play TTT. One file is for 2-players, the other is for 1 player against an AI.

## FindWord

Given a board of letters, it looks for a specified word contained.

## Game of Life

Conways game of life. Prints the grid into the terminal and the board needs to be initialized in the code.

Optimizations might come later with a pretty gui and faster speed.

## Mastermind_AI

The game of Mastermind but played against an AI that compares your responses with a list of all possible codes to narrow it down to one possible code, yours.
